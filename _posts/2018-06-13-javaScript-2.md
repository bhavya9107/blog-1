Hi readers 👋!!

Let's start Your JavaScript journey. Keep your first steps firmly and here I am to help you out.
If you are just getting started , don't freak out, just pass a comment below and you are ready to go!!<br>

**Introductions** <br>
Hi I am Rishabh Chawla and have been in programming since i was of 16 years of age. Have been a long journey , 
find more about me [here](https://rishabh3112.github.io/).<br>
Give your introduction below so that I can know more about you guys and gals and provide better help !! be sure to do that 👍

## Post Structure
**Prepare Backpack** <br>
>   1.1 Know JavaScript <br>
>   1.2 Set Up Environment<br>

## *1.1* Know JavaScript
In this section , I would be disscussing about JavaScript , it's importance and current developments.<br>
JavaScript is a *high-level* ( means close to our day to day language), *interpreted* (each line is executed freely without being directly dependent on error on previous lines) programming language. Its the official language of web 📶. Today, scope of JavaScript has increased not only in web domain but others too 😎. JavaScript is today used to write not only for **client side** (For browsers) but also for **server side** scripting( For writing server Scripts) using NodeJS. It is also used for **native app development** using many frameworks like ionic, Cordova, etc. to name the few. Not only this recently Google launched TensorFlow.js extending power of JavaScript to the domain of **machine learning**. <br>

Not only this it has been evolving and have become more mature. Some important advancedment includes:
1. TypeScript
2. Babel (ES6)
and improved standards comming frequently.

So, I would say you would never regret learning JavaScript !!

## *1.2* Set up Environment
Continuing JFS, Now as you have now made JavaScript your own and know its importance in today's development scene, know we can continue by taking another important step towards learning JavaScript which is **Setting up the environment**. You may think why should we setup whole set of tools and just start coding up, But,
> Having an efficient environment, leads to effective development output faster <br> -<small>Rishabh</small>😛

As you can start working on JavaScript with any text editor like *notepad* and even on web on platform *Codepen*, many people may prefer you to start your journey the hard way i.e. on notepad which don't have any development supporting addons/extensions. But I think the other way, one should start learning as,
> Knowing your tools early will equip you to be an effective developer early<br> -<small>Rishabh</small>😛

So know your tools is always the first step.
You may use any editor like
- Sublime
- Atom
- and many more
But I personally prefer and code on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because after trying many editors, I have ended up using VS code which I have been using for a year.<br>
Installation guide is available on respective site of editors. Facing any problems ?, Comment below and I will help you out.

In next post we would write our first line of code, Awesome 🤨??.
